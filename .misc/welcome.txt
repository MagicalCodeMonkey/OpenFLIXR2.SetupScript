Welcome to OpenFLIXR setup!
This will guide you through getting your OpenFLIXR box setup (mostly).
Once completed, you will need to configure the applications appropriately.

As you go through this, use the following to navaigate:
[up]/[down] to move between options
[space] to select an option
[tab] to move to buttons or back to the options
[page up]/[page down] to scroll

Good luck!
